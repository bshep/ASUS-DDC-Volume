# ASUS-DDC-Volume
OSX menubar to change the volume on your ASUS monitor
 
Will probably work on other brands but only tested on mine

# Caveats

- Will only control volume on the first monitor connected, you can change the source code if you want to control a different one

# Credits

- based on a utility called ddcctl which I found online at: https://github.com/kfix/ddcctl
